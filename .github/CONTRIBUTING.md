### Did you catch a bug?

**!!!Important!!!**  
If the bug poses a threat to the security of dependent applications, please refer to our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

There are two options available:

1. You can open an issue describing exactly:
   - What the bug is and what you expected to happen?
   - How it may be reproduced (It is often helpful to include images or alike).
   - hich versions of SpanExtensions.Net affected.
2. Even better, fix any issue yourself by submitting a pull request.

### Do you have a feature request?

Tell us all about it (here)[]. Please consider however, that features should generally be implementable via Extension Methods, otherwise they are unlikely to be accepted.

### Did you notice a mistake or an error in the documentation?

If you found a spelling mistake or an ambigous or unclear sentence or phrase in the XML documentation in C# source files or in any of the documentation for this repository (for example: Readme.md), do one of the following:

[Open an **Issue**](https://github.com/draconware-dev/SpanExtensions.Net/issues/new/choose) with the tag `documentation`. It is recommended to follow the [example template](https://github.com/draconware-dev/SpanExtensions.Net/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&projects=&template=documentation-report.md&title=Documentation+Error).

**OR**

[Open a **Pull Request**](https://github.com/draconware-dev/SpanExtensions.Net/compare) linked to an **Issue** tagged `documentation`, as grammatical errors are usually easier to fix, than they are to describe. In this case it is not necessary to describe the error in detail, a brief report with reasoning should do, unless it is not evident from the Pull Request, what actually was changed or why it was changed.
