## About

Never again switch back to using `string` instead of `ReadonlySpan<T>`, just because the method you seek is not supported.

**SpanExtensions.Net** aims to help developers use `ReadonlySpan<T>` and `Span<T>` more **productively**, **efficiently** and **safely** and write overall more **performant** Programs.
